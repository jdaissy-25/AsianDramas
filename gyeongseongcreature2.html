	<p>Gyeongseong Creature Season 2 shifts the narrative from 1945 Gyeongseong to modern-day Seoul, 79 years after the events of the first season. This time jump introduces a new era while continuing the story of Jang Tae-sang and Yoon Chae-ok, now known as Ho-jae and Silverbill. In 2024, Ho-jae operates a detective agency, unaware of his past life as Jang Tae-sang. Chae-ok, having survived the events of the first season, has become a tracker known as Silverbill. Both characters are immortal due to the Najin parasite, which grants them superhuman abilities but also a curse of insatiable hunger. Their paths cross once again as they confront a new threat: the Kuroko soldiers, humans who have been transformed into monstrous beings through the same experiments that created Chae-ok. In the concluding episodes, Chae-ok faces a dire situation where she is captured and subjected to a freezing water tank, leading to her apparent death. However, Ho-jae arrives in time to rescue her, and the Najin parasite exits her body. The season ends with Chae-ok living a normal life, rid of memories from the past.</p>
