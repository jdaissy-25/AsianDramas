	<p>“Business Proposal” is a romantic Korean drama that follows Shin Ha-ri, a hardworking office employee who agrees to go on a blind date pretending to be her wealthy best friend, Jin Young-seo. The twist? Her date turns out to be Kang Tae-moo, the CEO of the company she works for.</p>
<p>Tae-moo, tired of being pressured to marry, decides to marry the blind date girl immediately—unaware that she’s actually his employee in disguise. What follows are a load of comedic misunderstandings, fake identities, and slow-burn romance as Ha-ri tries to keep her secret and Tae-moo begins to fall for her.</p>
