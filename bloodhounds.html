	<p>“Bloodhounds” centers on Kim Geon-woo, a disciplined rookie boxer, and Hong Woo-jin, a charismatic former delinquent. Their paths cross during a national boxing tournament, leading to a fast friendship. Geon-woo's mother falls victim to Smile Capital, a predatory loan shark syndicate led by the sadistic Kim Myeong-gil. To protect her and others like her, Geon-woo and Woo-jin team up with Choi Tae-ho, a generous moneylender with a complex past, and his adopted daughter Hyeon-ju, an investigator. Together, they delve into the dangerous underworld of debt collection, facing off against Smile Capital's powerful enforcers.</p>
