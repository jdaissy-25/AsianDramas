	<p>Gyeongseong Creature is a South Korean historical horror series set in 1945 during the Japanese occupation of Korea. The first season intertwines supernatural elements with real historical atrocities, drawing inspiration from the infamous Unit 731 experiments. The story follows Jang Tae-sang, a wealthy pawnshop owner in Gyeongseong (now Seoul), who becomes entangled in a series of disappearances, including the one of Myeong-ja, the mistress of a Japanese police commissioner. His investigation leads him to Yoon Chae-ok, a skilled tracker searching for her missing mother. Together, they uncover a sinister plot involving Lieutenant Colonel Kato, who conducts horrific experiments at Ongseong Hospital using a parasitic organism called Najin. This organism transforms humans into monstrous creatures, serving as a weapon for the Japanese military. As the two delve deeper, they discover that Chae-ok's mother, Seishin, is one of Kato's creations, a being resulting from the Najin experiments. While exploring Kato’s underground lab further, Tae-sang is infected with the Najin by one of Kato’s creations. Moreover, in a tragic confrontation, Seishin attacks Chae-ok, leading to her death. However, in a shocking twist, Seishin recognizes Chae-ok as her daughter and also transfers the Najin organism into her, reviving Chae-ok with newfound abilities.</p>
